# Bank Account modeling

Context:

This program works around the problem of monetary transactions and a bank balance. The purpose of the program is to model a bank account, 
this means including an account holder, account number, password, balance, etc. This project includes objects and attributes so it is great 
for the purpose of the class. I think it is very interesting and I want to work with a subject like this because I think that it is a possibility 
that in the future I work in finance or banking.

For example the class will include the different bank accounts/owners. Each bank account/number will be another class of person type including name, age, etc, and will include objects like: balance. Through different methods the balance will increase or decrease and the transaction will be stored. These transactions will be interlinked between the accounts and that will reflect in the balances. It will also include number and account holder which will not change and are public. The password will be private.
