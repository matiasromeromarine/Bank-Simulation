# Proyect-OOP: Bank Account modeling

Context:

This program works around the problem of monetary transactions and a bank balance. The purpose of the program is to model a bank account, 
this means including an account holder, account number, password, balance, etc. This project includes objects and attributes so it is great 
for the purpose of the class. I think it is very interesting and I want to work with a subject like this because I think that it is a possibility 
that in the future I work in finance or banking.
